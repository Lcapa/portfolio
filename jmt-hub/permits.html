            <h3>You need a wilderness permit to hike the John Muir Trail</h3>
            <p>Permits for the JMT can, unfortunately, be quite complicated to sort out. Thankfully, I'm going to guide you through the complete process and help make it as easy as possible. In the following section I will explain the permit process and what factors to account for when filling them out.</p>

            <h2>Applying For Permits</h2>
            <p>Permits for the John Muir Wilderness are issued 168 days or 24 weeks in advance of your chosen start date via a lottery system. Unfortunately this means obtaining a permit for your JMT hike is heavily dependent on luck. For this reason obtaining permits is said by many to be the most frustrating part of planning your JMT trip, especially considering that 97% of all south bound permit applications are denied. But it has become easier to apply with the introduction of online applications and a rolling lottery.</p>
            <p>There are two points that hikers start the JMT from: the Northern terminus in Yosemite (Called SOBO or South Bound JMT) and the Southern terminus on the summit of Mount Whitney (Called NOBO or North Bound JMT). Depending on your starting location you will need to apply for permits from different offices.</p>
            <h3>Southern Terminus</h3>
            <p>If you prefer to travel Northward (NOBO) you can start at the Whitney Portal and exit in Yosemite. This route is only recommended for experienced backpackers. It is significantly more difficult than a SOBO route because all of the most difficult passes and altitude changes will occur in the first half of your trip. The submission timeframe is from February 1 to March 15, which comes after most people would be applying for the SOBO permits. For these reasons a NOBO trip would better serve as a backup plan if the SOBO application falls through.</p>
            <span>More information can be found on the <a href="http://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/inyo/passes-permits/recreation/?cid=stelprdb5150055">Forest Service Website</a> and you can apply at <a href="http://www.recreation.gov/permits/Mt_Whitney/r/wildernessAreaDetails.do?page=detail&contractCode=NRSO&parkId=72201">Recreation.gov</a>.</span>
            <h3>Northern Terminus</h3>
            <h4>If you are starting at the Northern terminus and exiting at Donahue pass then you will need a permit from Yosemite. You can start the application by going <a href="https://yosemite.org/jmt-rolling-lottery-application/">here</a>.</h4>
            <h4>Start Dates</h4>
            <p>The first step in applying for JMT permits is choosing a start date. As I mentioned before, applications are processed by random lottery 168-170 days in advance. It is very important to choose a good range of start dates so you have adequate time to request work off or plan around school schedules. For a July 1 start date, you would need to submit an application on January 13, with the drawing set for January 14. Applications close at 7:30 AM on the day of the drawing. This table on the nps website is very useful for scheduling your permit submissions: <a href="https://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/wildpermitdates.htm">Wilderness Permits Reservations</a>.</p>
            <h4>Entry point and 1st Night Campground</h4>
            <p>After you choose your starting point, the next step is selecting your starting trailhead. Hiking the JMT SOBO from Yosemite Valley will take you over Donahue Pass, which as of 2017, has an exit quota of 45 hikers per day. These five options will all take you up and over Donahue pass and are subject to the 45 hikers a day quota. For options 1-4 permits for 20 people will be made available each day by reservation. For option 5 permits for 25 people will be made available each day, 15 by reservation and 10 for walk ups.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Happy Isles to Sunrise/Merced Lakes Pass Through</li>
                <li>Happy Isles to Little Yosemite Valley</li>
                <li>Glacier Point to Little Yosemite Valley</li>
                <li>Sunrise Lakes (Tenaya Lake South)</li>
                <li>Lyell Canyon</li>
            </ul>
            <p>On the form you will be asked to rank the 5 trailheads in order of preference. The trailheads will be covered in more detail with maps and explanation on the <a href="./trail-maps.html">next page</a>.</p>
            <h4>Exit point &amp; Trip Duration</h4>
            <p>For a John Muir Trail through hike your SOBO exit trailhead should be the Mount Whitney Portal.</p>
            <p>You can now submit just one application for a 21 day period. This is the rolling reservation I mentioned earlier. For any 21 day period of potential start dates that you select, your reservation will be rolled over to the next day if it is denied. If your application is denied for the whole 21 day window, you are free to reapply with a new window.</p>
            <p>From the NPS website: <em> “…you will submit one application for a range of dates up to 3 weeks (21 days) long. Your reservation application will be placed in each day’s daily lottery for the date span you provide. You will be notified of lottery results each day via email. If denied, your application will roll to the next day’s lottery. The application will be removed from the rolling lottery if 1) your request is granted 2) is manually cancelled by applicant or 3) the date range has been exceeded…”</em></p>
            <h4>Group Size</h4>
            <p>The next step is to select your desired group size and minimum group size. The maximum is 15.</p>
            <h4>Half Dome</h4>
            <p>For all starting trailheads you have the option of getting a Half Dome permit. If you plan on summiting Half Dome, you should answer yes and select the number of people summiting.</p>
            <h4>Finalizing</h4>
            <p>There is additional information you must fill out such as the personal details of the trip leader and whether you plan on going with a guide or pack animals, fill this info out as it best pertains to your trip.</p>
            <h4>Waiting for a Response</h4>
            <p>Within 24 hours of the lottery application draw date, you should receive an email stating whether or not your request was successful. If you are successful then you can pick your permits up at one of the five yosemite valley wilderness centers. The permit will be held until 10am on the day of your trip. If you’re going to be late, make sure to call ahead and let them know (209-372-0308). It might be easier to pick it up the day before and stay the night in a backpacker camp in yosemite. If you don't get the SOBO permits for a through trip and you aren't doing a NOBO trip, then you can get creative and choose a route that avoids Donahue Pass. <a href="https://www.yosemiteconservancy.org/yosemite-wilderness-permit-request-form">Online applications for these options are available here.</a></p>
            <p>That about sums up the permit process. If you still have questions you can always look at the <a href="https://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/wpres.htm">NPS Website</a> for more information. Otherwise, you can <a href="./trail-maps.html">continue</a> on for a more detailed look at the starting trailheads and for some useful trailmaps to help you plan.</p>
