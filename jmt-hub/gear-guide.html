            <p>Gear Guide &amp; Resupply</p>
        </div>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Choosing what gear you need to bring can be very difficult for any backpacking trip, even more so for a JMT thru trip. The goal is to bring all of the essentials while minimizing the weight in your bag. It's a difficult balance to achieve because if you miss some essential items you could find yourself in a very inconvenient spot, but if you carry too much you'll tire much faster and you won't be able to maintain the pace necessary to complete the trip within your time range. Even worse if you go too slow you might miss your resupply drops. In the following section I'm going to guide you through gear you should bring and the resupply process. Lets get started.</p>

            <div class="img-attr">
                <picture>
                    <source srcset="images/man-standing-on-top-of-mountain.webp " type="image/webp">

                </picture>
            </div>
            <h2>Pack weight</h2>
            <p>For a short trip a pack weight of between 40 - 60 pounds (18 - 27 kilos) is common. For a long trip, however, you would want to carry between 20 - 40 pounds (9 - 18 kilos) for pacing and resupply. Let me explain a bit more: in a short trip you carry all of the gear and food you need for the whole trip from start to finish, but in a long trip the weight of your gear will vary based on your resupply drops so you need to have a low enough weight in your bag to pick up more food and water supplies without becoming overencumbered. Also with a heavier pack your pace will be slower, you'll be less comfortable, and you won't cover as many miles in a day. For a JMT thru hike this is problematic because it is essential that you stick to your planned pace so that you can pick up supplies and go over passes on time.</p>
            <p>In order to get your pack weight into the sweet spot you need to establish the base weight of your pack, or the weight of the pack without any consumable items like water, gas, and food. The weight of your consumable items will continuously fluctuate as you use them and resupply so if you have a low base weight you can stay in the sweet spot for the whole trip. That being said, the sweet spot for you will vary greatly depending on how fast you wish to complete the JMT. Many people try to finish the JMT within 10 to 12 days which would require walking about 20 miles (32 kilometers) a day. With a pack more than 30 pounds it will be very difficult to make it that far each day because you will tire faster and simply won't be able to walk as fast. If you are willing to take a 20 day or so trip then you can go 10 miles per day and as a result you can carry more weight. This is something you'll need to decide based on your own limits.</p>

            <h2>Equipment Checklist</h2>
            <p>
                This list includes a number of items that are considered essential for the JMT and for any backcountry trip as well as the ten essential systems you should have on every backcountry trip: navigation, sun protection, insulation, illumination, first-aid supplies, fire starter, repair kit and tools, nutrition, hydration, emergency shelter. They are divided up into 4 categories Equipment, Clothing &amp; Shoes, Food, and Personal Necessities. It's wise to take a few small trips before the JMT to familiarize yourself with your gear and to train your body. There are many useful guides online that can also help you decide on what gear to take such as <a href="https://www.rei.com/learn/expert-advice/thru-hiking-goal-training.html">REIs Ultralight Backpacking Guide</a>
            </p>

            <h3>Equipment</h3>

                <li>*Bear Cannister</li>
                <li>*Tent - preferably a 3 season tent</li>

                <li>*Cooking Stove</li>
                <li>*Cooking Pots - </li>
                <li>*Knife or Multitool</li>
                <li>*Headlamp with Batteries</li>
                <li>*Water Filter and Backup Treatment Tablets</li>
                <li>*Stove, Fuel, and Repair Kit</li>
                <li>*Lighter or matches</li>
                <li>*Mess Kit</li>
                <li>*Duct Tape</li>
                <li>*Fire Starter</li>
                <li>*Pack Raincover</li>
                <li>Tarp - Multiple uses, keeps you off wet ground</li>
                <li>Watch - if you care what time it is</li>
                <li>Hiking Poles or Walking Stick</li>
                <li>Ice Spikes</li>
                <li>Ice Axe (Depending on snow fall)</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Clothing &amp; Shoes</h3>
            <div class="img-attr">
                <img src="./images/boots.jpg" alt="Hiking Boots on Stairs">
            </div>
            <p>Wicking and quick drying clothes are a must for backcountry expeditions. You won't be able to bring many changes of clothes and the Sierra Nevadas are very wet in the summertime. There is nothing more uncomfortable than having to hike while wet so be prepared. It can also get very cold, windy, and rainy in the high altitudes so make sure you have an insulated coat and rain/wind protection.</p>
            <p>Keep in mind the type of trail when you are selecting your shoes. The Sierra Nevada Wilderness is well travelled but the trails are rough, craggy, and uneven so it's essential to understand the difference between "Hiking" shoes or boots and "Backpacking" shoes or boots. Backpacking shoes or boots are designed for high weight, stability, and impact resistance to provide support and comfort on rough terrain with 30 - 60 lbs (18 - 27 kilos) of pack weight. Hiking shoes or boots are meant for short trips with a day pack on even, well groomed trails. They <strong>will not</strong> provide enough support for backpacking and will lead to really sore, blistered feet. Furthermore, it's essential that you make sure they fit perfectly and, if possible, you break them in before the trip.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>*Wicking, Quick-drying Underwear</li>
                <li>*Wicking, Quick-drying Sports Bra</li>
                <li>*Wicking, Quick-drying Long Underwear</li>
                <li>*Pants - to protect your legs</li>
                <li>*Shorts</li>
                <li>*Backpacking Boots or Shoes</li>
                <li>*Socks - multiple pairs in case some get wet, thick fleece ones are best</li>
                <li>*Insulated Jacket - down or wool works best</li>
                <li>*Bandana or Buff - it gets very dusty on the trail</li>
                <li>*Sun Shielding Hat</li>
                <li>*Waterproof Rain coat or Cloak</li>
                <li>Ankle-high Gaiters - protects your ankles from brush and your ice spikes</li>
                <li>Winter Hat</li>
                <li>Gloves</li>
                <li>Sandals or Water Shoes</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Personal Necessities</h3>
            <p>Sun protection is essential, bring adequate supplies. Select items that you think you'll need but keep in mind the additional weight.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>*Sunglasses - sunlight in high altitudes and around snow can give you snow blindness.</li>
                <li>*Sunscreen</li>
                <li>*First Aid Kit - see the REI <a href="https://www.rei.com/learn/expert-advice/first-aid-checklist.html">First Aid Guide</a></li>
                <li>*Toothbrush</li>
                <li>*Biodegradable Soap</li>
                <li>*Toilet Paper</li>
                <li>*Personal Hygiene Items - Wipes, cleanser, tampons, etc.</li>
                <li>*Medications</li>
                <li>*Insect Repellent - Mosquitos can be brutal in the meadows</li>
                <li>*Cell Phone</li>
                <li>Chap Stick</li>
                <li>*Wallet, ID, Cash, Credit Card</li>
                <li>*JMT Permit</li>
                <li>Sanitization Trowel - You are not allowed to do your business in the bushes in certain parts of the trail</li>
                <li>Wipes</li>
                <li>Eye Glasses (if necessary)</li>
                <li>Zip Lock Bags - very useful for keeping things dry.</li>
                <li>Mosquito Net</li>
                <li>Quick Dry Towel</li>
                <li>Field Guide</li>
                <li>Camera</li>
                <li>Binoculars</li>
                <li>Journal, Pen, Reading Material</li>
                <li>Fishing Gear and Permit</li>
                <li>Other Permits</li>
                <li>Itinerary</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Food</h3>
            <p>You will need to eat between 3000 - 6000 calories per day to maintain your energy levels. The best option is to bring freeze dried meals because they are very light and simple to cook. Lunch will usually be food you can eat on the go so you don't have to stop and set up a cooking station.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Breakfast - oatmeal, granola, <a href="https://www.rei.com/c/freeze-dried-breakfasts">freeze-dried breakfast</a></li>
                <li>Lunch - bagel, sausage, cheese, smoked salmon, jerky, etc</li>
                <li>Dinner - Pasta, rice, <a href="https://www.rei.com/c/freeze-dried-dinners">freeze-dried dinner</a></li>
                <li>Snacks</li>
                <li>Energy Bars - clif bars are a good choice</li>
                <li>Electrolyte drink - like gatorade</li>
                <li>Extra Day's supply of food - picked up and carried each leg of the trip</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Resupply</h3>
            <p>Resupply will require some organization and planning beforehand. You will put together boxes of a day or so worth of supplies you think you will need and then you will organize shipping and delivery with a trail supply company such as <a href="https://www.trailsupplyco.com/">Trail Supply CO.</a> They make the process very simple and are very flexible. If necessary you can even create new orders or change drop points while on the trail (if you can get cell service).</p>
            <p>Do your best to choose gear that will serve you well during your trip. Make sure to optimize your weight/comfort ratio by trying a few short day hikes with weight to find your limits. Keep in mind the more you train, the more you can carry comfortably. Make an itinerary for food drop based on what you think your pace will be and what point you will reach on each day of the trip.</p>
            <p>That concludes this guide to the John Muir Trail. If you intend to make the trip, enjoy yourself and really take in the serene beauty of the high mountain landscapes.
