            <h2>John Muir Trail Guide </h2>
            <hr>
            <p>Getting Started - Q/A, Rules &amp; Regulations</p>
        </div>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Despite it's incredible beauty, the John Muir trail is a difficult hike that should not be underestimated. There are many important things to consider when you plan your trip that I hope to help you with in this guide.</p>
            <div class="img-attr">

            <h3>How long does it take to hike the John Muir Trail?</h3>
            <p>It takes roughly a month to hike the 211 miles of the John Muir Trail, but the length of the trip ultimately depends on your pace so it is essential that you get a decent idea of how fast you will go and how far you intend to hike each day. The John Muir Trail is too long for you to carry all of the food you need so If you don’t have an idea of your pace beforehand it can make it very difficult to organize meal pickups and resource planning. For example, if you plan to make it to a certain pass or area at a specific date to pick up food supplies but you hike too slowly, then you may find yourself without food and in a precarious situation. These kinds of issues cause many people to abandon their trip partway through, which is never something that we want.</p>
            <h3>When should I hike the John Muir Trail?</h3>
            <p>The best time to hike the John Muir trail is between June and September. Any earlier, and the snowpack on high passes can make the journey slow going and treacherous. However, if snowfall is particularly high for a given year, then the passes may not be traversable until as late as July. If you leave too late, you will face trouble with the stormy weather of the fall season. Keep this in mind while you plan, but June to September is more than enough time to pull off a trip down the John Muir Trail. If you decide to leave earlier, the weather will be cooler, there won't be as many other hikers, the bugs won't be out en masse yet, and there are abundant water sources. In September, the conditions are similar to leaving early in the year, less bugs, people, and heat.</p>
            <hr>
            <h2>Rules and Regulations</h2>
            <p>The John Muir Trail passes through multiple different national parks and national forests and the rules and regulations must be followed for each of them. It's a good idea to keep a copy of the rules with you while you travel. A list of all the rules mentioned in the next section can be found at <a href="https://www.pcta.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/John-Muir-Trail-Regulations.pdf">this page</a>.</p>
            <h3>General Travel Requirements</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Wilderness permits are required for all overnight travel.</li>

                    and must be presented to ranger upon request.</li>
                <li>Group size limit is 15 people or less.</li>
                <li>To prevent erosion, please walk in the middle of the trail
                    and do not short-cut trails even if it is muddy or snowy.</li>
                <li>Do not build rock cairns or other trail markers.</li>
                <li>No caching food or gear in the wilderness.</li>

            </ul>
            <br>
            <strong>Yosemite, Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks</strong>
            <ul>

                <li>Pets are not allowed.</li>

                    state regulations.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <hr>
            <h3>Food Storage</h3>
            <p>In all wilderness areas along
                the JMT, <strong><u>proper food storage is
                        mandatory</u></strong>. Properly store food
                items when not in use to prevent
                bears and other wildlife from
                becoming conditioned to human
                food. Items that must be secured
                include all types of food, food
                related trash, and scented items
                such as toiletries, soap, toothpaste,
                ointments, and lotions.</p>
            <h4>Proper Food Storage Methods</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Portable food storage container (bear canister) is the recommended
                    method of protecting your food. Ensure the lid is closed properly and store
                    the canister on the ground 50 feet from your sleeping area.</li>
                <li>Permanent Food Storage Box (limited locations) are for on-site use only,
                    caching a food resupply, or leaving unwanted items is prohibited.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Animal Resistant Food Storage Container Required Areas along the JMT:</h4>
            <em>*Only allowed canisters can be used.</em>
            <ul>
                <li>All of Yosemite NP wilderness</li>
                <li>Donahue Pass to Reds Meadow</li>
                <li>Duck Lake to Lake Virginia </li>
                <li>Dusy Basin/Bishop Pass corridor</li>
                <li>Pinchot Pass to Forester Pass</li>
                <li>Kearsarge Lakes/Pass corridor</li>
                <li>Whitney Zone (Inyo NF)</li>
                <li>Rock Creek/Cottonwood Pass/
                    Cottonwood Lakes</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>Counter-balance hanging technique may be used where portable containers
                are not mandatory. However, food items must be suspended at least 15 feet
                in the air and 10 feet out from the trunk of the tree with no rope hanging
                down. Where trees are not adequate for hanging food you must use a
                portable food storage container</p>
            <hr>
            <h3>Sanitation &amp; Waste Disposal</h3>
            <h4>Please pack out all garbage. Do not burn or bury.</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>To protect water quality and public health, move well off-trail, away from camp,
                    and at least 100 feet away from all water sources to urinate.</li>
                <li>Solid human waste must be buried in soil 6 to 8 inches deep, at least 100 feet
                    from trails, camps, and all water sources. Pack out all toilet paper and hygiene
                    products to preserve the wilderness experience for others. </li>
                <li>All soap, including biodegradable soap, can injure fish and other aquatic wildlife.
                    Carry wash water 100 feet from lakes, streams, or other water sources before
                    washing. Strain dishwater and pack out solid particles, scatter grey water 100 feet
                    away from water sources. This includes washing clothes, dishes, and yourself.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Mt. Whitney Area:</h4>
            <p> All visitors are
                expected to pack out their solid
                human waste between Guitar Lake
                and Whitney Portal. All used waste
                kits must be packed out and
                deposited in the designated
                containers next to the restrooms at
                Whitney Portal trailhead. Waste kits
                should be picked up with your permit.
                Additional waste kits are available at
                Crabtree Ranger Station Junction.</p>
            <hr>
            <h3>Campsite Selection</h3>
            <p>In all wilderness areas along the John Muir Trail (JMT)
                campsites must be on durable surfaces such as dirt,
                gravel, or rock a minimum of 100 feet (30 meters/40
                paces) away from water sources and the trail. Do not
                camp on vegetation or in meadows. Campsites should
                not be visible from the trail. Use legal existing sites
                where possible. Do not construct rock walls, trenches,
                new fire rings (or add rocks to existing fire rings), bough
                beds, camp furniture, etc.</p>

            <h3>Campfire Regulations</h3>
            <p>Help to leave no trace of your visit by considering not
                having a campfire. If you must, please do the following:
                where fires are allowed, use existing fire rings. Do not
                build new ones or add rocks to existing fire rings. Leave
                your ax and saw at home. Use only dead wood found on
                the ground. Do not chop live vegetation or remove dead
                branches from trees. </p>
            <p>Fires must be attended at all times. Do not burn trash.
                Drown the fire with water, stir the ashes, feel to make
                sure it is cold. Do not use dirt to put out fires. </p>
            <p>Note that during times of high fire danger, additional
                campfire restrictions may be implemented. Use of a
                wood-burning camp stove is not allowed where camp
                fires are prohibited. <br>
                <strong>Site-specific campfire closures exist outside of the JMT
                    corridor. See agencies for more details if planning a detour. </strong></p>
            <h4>Yosemite National Park:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Campfires are prohibited above 9,600 feet in elevation.</li>
                <li>Campfires are prohibited in the Cathedral Lakes Basin. </li>
